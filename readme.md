## What is an awesome list?

This repository lists the most awesome Arduino libraries. It's a curated list driven by Arduino and its community to share the best libraries for various use cases. To provide a better overview the libraries are divided into different categories which can be added as the list continues to grow.

The goal of this list is to provide a centralized resource for Arduino libraries, supporting both beginners and advanced users. We aim to foster collaboration within the Arduino community and showcase high-quality libraries that follow good coding standards and are well-documented.

## How to contribute

This repository is currently moderated by Arduino but anyone is welcome to contribute and share libraries that they think other people should know about. You can either submit an issue or open a PR telling us which awesome libraries you think should be added.

This repository follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
